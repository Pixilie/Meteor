Meteor is a little Python program that gives climatic and meteorological information by using the API OpenWeatherMap.
For security reason I can't give you the token but you can create one easily on https://OpenWeatherMap.org .
For the program to work you need to install the 4 librairies of the requirements.txt file.
If you find any issues you can contact me on my discord : Kristen#1827.
